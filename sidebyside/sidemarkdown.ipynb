"# Example: Using Markdown Content\n",
"\n",
"This file demonstrates how to write Markdown document with\n",
"embedded F# snippets that can be transformed into nice HTML\n",
"using the `literate.fsx` script from the [F# Formatting\n",
"package](http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Formatting).\n",
"\n",
"In this case, the document itself is a valid Markdown and\n",
"you can use standard Markdown features to format the text:\n",

"## Writing F# code\n",
"\n",
"In standard Markdown, you can include code snippets by\n",
"writing a block indented by four spaces and the code\n",
"snippet will be turned into a `\u003cpre\u003e` element. If you do\n",

"## Hiding code\n",
"\n",
"If you want to include some code in the source code,\n",
